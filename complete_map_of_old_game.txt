Oh my god, it's the last day of school and you realize that if you do NOT bring
home good grades your parents are going to roast you like the turkey you are.
And even WORSE is that you have to go to summer school with Brenda, the ugly
neighbor! Something has got to be done, or else the whole summer... all your
free time... your LIFE, will be destroyed!

AAAAARRRRRGGGGGGHHHHH!!!

You arrive at school in the morning, and you have got the best plan an eleven
year-old bubble-gum-pumped-boy could have. If you pull this off, you'll be THE k
id the rest of your life. All you have to do is break in wherever those grades
are and change them. Go boy!


POST INTRO

You look down the hallway and see a lot of lockers accompanied with the one fire
alarm in the ceiling. You can also see your locker, the one place where you have
kept all your stolen frogs and firecrackers throughout the years in school, so,
naturally there is one FOUL odor steaming from the innermost corner of it.


HALLWAY

    ALARM - State 1

    You are walking towards the alarm so that you can examine it.
    With the head bent back, you're looking curiously at the fire alarm.
    "What can I use to start the alarm? Water...? No...
    Fire! Yeah, that's it! But where do they have fire in a school?"

        use lighter

        You used the lighter.
        ALARM!!! The fire alarm is screaming out it's most burning fantasies. All the
        people in the cafeteria are running out in panic. And the principal has
        forgotten his keycard. Pity. ;)

    ALARM - State 2

    You are walking towards the alarm so that you can examine it.
    The alarm is on and you'll probably get tinitus standing this close!

    LOCKER

    After a short walk you are standing by your locker.
    Locker number 13: Inside there's a chemestry book, some gum and a picture of
    Barbara Streisand - eeew!

    I Hallway
        use keycard

        You used the keycard.
        Office door is unlocked, good     <----- Punkt saknas

    I Hallway
        use knife

        You used the knife.
        With your handy-dandy lockpicking knowledge you slide the knife
        in the doorspring, and with a twitch of your hand you unlocked
        the door. Ahhh.. technology these days, so safe!

1001

The door opens like a well oiled... door.
You can see a bunch of small desks and a larger teachers desk with a drawer
under it. On the desk lies a paper with something written on it.

    DESK - State 1

    You start examine the desk.
    Oh lord! The paper on the desk is your English grade, a D+. This you must change
    unless you want to commit mental suicide. (Tip: try erasing the text somehow)
    In the drawer lies the one pen.

        pickup pen

    DESK - State 2

    You start examine the desk.
    The only thing left on the desk is your grade.

        use magicerase

        You used the magicerase.
        You smear on some MagicErase and your D+ fades away.

        use pen

        You used the pen.
        Utilizing your beloved pen, and without concern, you gently write the letter A
        followed by a plus.
        You're one BADASS now. You've got A+ in English. Feeling better already?

        use pen

        You used the pen.
        No use to do that though. English grade already changed.

1002

Entering the dark room of chemistry, you see the blinking interface of a
computer. All the nuclear radiation has made the screen glow green... or else
it's just an old computer.

    COMPUTER - State 1

    You walk up to the computer and push the button to start it.
    Bzzzzzzklllrrrrrrrkkkchnngngggggg.............
    "Enter password:"                                            <------------------ Skriv ut en bokstav i taget

    Man! The old Beast tells you to give him the Magic Word. Where could you ever
    find that password?

        use paper

        You used the paper.
        Tick, tick, tick.... chong!
        "Enter password: ILoveMyJob
        You are now logged in as Margaret Thatcher!"

        While browsing the files you see one file more interesting than the others. It's
        the file containing your grade. Now it's just one tap on the keyboard and your f
        oul C turns in to a beautiful A+!

        "Press ENTER to change the grade to: 'A+'"   <--- Paus innan samt skrivs ut en bokstav i taget

        <VÄNTAR PÅ ENTER-TRYCK>

        Grade has been changed - No more biology this year!

    COMPUTER - State 2

    You sit down by the computer.
    "Enter password:"

        use paper

        You used the paper.
        No use to do that though. Biology grade already changed.

1003

Entering classroom 1003.

    TRASHCAN - State 1

    You look down the trash can.
    Ooo, a lighter! And... a dead frog! God it stinks!

        pickup lighter

    TRASHCAN - State 2

    You look down the trash can.
    The only thing left in the trashcan is the dead frog.

    DESK - State 1

    You start examine the desk.
    Hm... This certainly is a big pile of papers, a piece of paper may actually come
    in handy - i think.

        pickup paper

    DESK - State 2

    You start examine the desk.
    You already have a paper, no reason to take another one...


1004

Entering classroom 1004.

    BOOKSHELF - State 1

    You browse through the books in the bookshelf.
    Hm... This book seems to be connected to something... A button maybe?

        pickup book

        You tried to pick up the book.
        What the ----! The bookshelf's opening, it seems to be a secret room. No wonder
        the room was so small. And... What's THAT?! The French teacher is having an
        affair with the secretary - grose!

        - "Wha- what are you doing here?! Say ONE word about this to anyone and you're  <---- Skrivs ut en bokstav i taget
        dead mister!"
        - "It's OK, I won't... As long as you change my grade in French to an A+!"

        Aaah, blackmailing; it always works! The teacher and the secretary rushes out of
        the room, while you've got A+ in French - Sweet!

    BOOKSHELF - Sate 2

    [Ingen ny text, jämfört med State 1]

        pickup book

        You tried to pick up the book.
        But for no reason, because the 'door' is already open and French grade changed
        to an A+.


1005 - State 1

Chuck, chuck.
Argh, the door to room 1005 seems to be locked.
- "If I only had something solid and thin to pick the lock with..."

You are still in the hallway.


1005 - State 2

That lock seemed to be an easy match to you.
In here you find yourself standing by a couple of generic school benches
and a regular desk with a drawer.

    DESK - State 1

    On the desk lies nothing but dust.
    On the other hand there's a bottle of magicerase in the bottom of the drawer.
    Aaah.. magicerase, the only that works if you want to erase something permanent
    on a paper!

        pickup magicerase

    DESK - State 2

    On the desk lies nothing but dust.
    And nothing left in the drawer... except more dust.


CAFETERIA - State 1

You see a bunch of students stuffing their faces with the culinary
disaster of school food. With your knowledge you know that nothing
but fire could move these people out of their seats...

    TABLE - State 1

    You recognize the face of your arch enemy - The Principal, and beside
    him lies the keycard to his office. Somehow you know that you need that
    keycard. You just don't know how to get it.
    And there are some knives and forks on the table too.
    Knives are thin and solid...

        pickup knife (funkar)

        pickup keycard (funkar inte)

        Invalid: Seems like you have to do something else before using that.

CAFETERIA - State 2

With the ringing of the fire-alarm in the air, no one is present in this room ex
cept you which is always taken by some kiss up-seatwarmer-student.      <---------------- FEL?! Jämför med TABLE (2)
...and with the firealarm ringing in the air no one is left in the cafeteria.

    TABLE - State 2

    As you look across a mutilated table of school lunch you notice
    the prescence of the keycard by the seat the principal sat by before,
    which is otherwise always taken by some kiss up-seatwarmer-student.
    And there still are some knives and forks here.

    pickup keycard

    OBS: Om man undersöker borde igen så stårt det att det ligger ett keycard där!


QUARTERS

You find out that this room is the lair of which all evil spawns from.
Do what you must, and leave quick is your first thought. There is a book
hanging from a chain in the wall and by that book is a telephone machine.
The last thing you notice is that the teachers seem to... smile? That
thought is thrown away as fast as you realize your starting to like it in here.

    CODEBOOK - State 1

    This seems to be a code book... oh god.    <---- Punkt? Liten bokstav
    there is an interesting code there!

        use paper

        You write down the code gracefully on your very own paper.

        OBS: Att använda pappret igen gör att man skriver av koden igen. Borde vara "you already have the code"...

    CODEBOOK - State 2

    This seems to be a code book... oh god.
    Cool.. you know this code already.


OFFICE - State 1

Chuck, chuck.
Argh, the door to the office seems to be locked...
... but it has a keycard reader!     <---------------- Paus innan detta dyker upp

You are still in the hallway.


OFFICE - State 2

You get into the principals office, not that you never have done that
before, but now you're here all alone. That's creepy.

Anyway, the thing that you can see here is a folded laptop on the edge of
a desk. It looks attractively expensive, and yet it is scary to want to
have it since you never know what the principal does in here.

    LAPTOP - State 1

    With the luck you're blessed with, the principal has forgotten the whole
    schools Behavior grades. Pick it up and use it or not?

    What to do?

    W h a t  t o  d o... ... ... ?   <---- skrivs ut en bokstav i taget

        pickup laptop

        You have to change all the grades before picking this up...  <--- Aha, man måste ha fixat alla ANDRA betyg!
        Invalid: You cannot perform that command here/yet.

    LAPTOP - State 2

        pickup laptop

        You picked up the laptop.

        use laptop

        Well, as the well behaved and not least to say, GENEROUS, you decide to
        give everyone is school a summer present. An A+ in behaviour.

        BAM BAM!!!

        Someone is knocking on the door, and judging by the voice it's the principal
        and his no-good henchman, the janitor, which have come to... get inside the
        office.

        Fast as a rat you escape JUST in time through the window of the office.   <------ Paus här innan nsta rad
        Now, before you, lies freedom of summer!!! Yeah!! All you think of is that
        great guy in the sky. God, thank you!

        NOT!!!


        GAME FINISH

        But we do thank you!
        Not only because you changed all the students grades, but that you had the
        patience, passion, generosity, etc to finish our game. Thanks a lot!

        //Marcus and Joakim of the "A+ Quest" team. Good night!
